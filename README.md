# Genshin-Coordinate
**Genshin STP coordinate files**
> **version:v3.6**
> 
> **STP files are based on Internet document data.**
>
> **The data added after version 3.4 may differ from the actual in-game data.**
>
> **The data is accurate to a high degree, but there are still a small number of coordinates that are empty.**
> 
>**Reasons:**
>>**1. Refreshable guard monsters are refreshed if a treasure chest exists. If a treasure chest is opened, it will not be refreshed, and such points are included in the file.**
>>
>>**2. Data updated after v3.4 may not be fully included, depending on subsequent changes made by the M Company.**
>>
>>**3. Other reasons not found**
